# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project üéóÔ∏è

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model for the **early diagnosis of breast cancer** based on features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses. Accurate and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This solution leverages data analysis and classification algorithms to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. It contains 569 instances, each representing a cell nucleus from a breast mass.

**Attribute Information:**
The dataset includes an ID number, a diagnosis, and **30 real-valued features** that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei. These features are calculated as the mean, standard error, and "worst" (largest) value for each of ten primary measurements:

  * **Radius**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter.
  * **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
  * **Perimeter**
  * **Area**
  * **Smoothness**: Local variation in radius lengths.
  * **Compactness**: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0.
  * **Concavity**: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
  * **Concave points**: Number of concave portions of the contour.
  * **Symmetry**
  * **Fractal Dimension**: "Coastline approximation" - 1.

**Class Distribution:**

  * **Benign (B)**: 357 instances
  * **Malignant (M)**: 212 instances

The dataset has no missing attribute values, except for an extraneous 'Unnamed: 32' column which was identified during data inspection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing

The initial phase involved loading the dataset and performing an initial inspection. The `id` column and the `Unnamed: 32` column (which contained entirely null values) were dropped as they were not relevant for the classification task. The `diagnosis` column, containing 'M' (Malignant) and 'B' (Benign), was converted into a numerical format, likely 1 for Malignant and 0 for Benign, to be suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## ü§ñ Model & Results

A machine learning classification model was developed to predict the diagnosis (malignant or benign) based on the extracted features. The model's performance was evaluated using a **classification report**, which provides key metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score for each class, as well as overall accuracy.

Here is the classification report from the model's evaluation:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.98      0.99       108  (Benign)
           1       0.97      0.98      0.98        63  (Malignant)

    accuracy                           0.98       171
   macro avg       0.98      0.98      0.98       171
weighted avg       0.98      0.98      0.98       171
```

**Key Performance Highlights:**

  * **Overall Accuracy**: The model achieved an impressive **98% accuracy** on the test set.
  * **Malignant Class (1)**: The model demonstrated exceptional ability in identifying malignant cases with a **precision of 0.97**, **recall of 0.98**, and an **f1-score of 0.98**. This indicates a high rate of correctly identified malignant tumors, crucial for early intervention.
  * **Benign Class (0)**: Performance for benign cases was also excellent, with a **precision of 0.99**, **recall of 0.98**, and an **f1-score of 0.99**.
